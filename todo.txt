My_shell (actually 42 Minishell)

================================ Main Structure ================================
1) Input (Easy)
	It take user input and convert to string called cmd_str, important fuction is readline.
	This part contain user interface of minishell and clean program & exit.
2) Lexer (Hard)
	When user input received (cmd_str != NULL) we seperate it to several string per these rule
	2.1	At quote, preceeded by space (either " or ') until it reach another quote with the same preceeding value.
		Here's the example.
		1/	cmd_str = here 'come the' star
			lexed = here -> 'come the' -> star
		2/	cmd_str = I 'am "the" hunter' Sova
			lexed = I -> 'am "the" hunter' -> Sova
		3/	cmd_str = To 'eternity' "and beyond
			lexed = To -> 'eternity' -> "and beyond
		4/	cmd_str = ls -la "|grep another"
			lexed = ls -> -la -> "| grep another"
	2.2	At spacebar until it reach another spacebar
		Here's the example.
		1/	cmd_str = A whole new world
			lexed = A -> whole -> new -> world
		2/	cmd_str = Wish I c"oul"d be part of t'h'at wor'ld'
			lexed = Wish -> I -> c"oul"d -> be -> part -> of -> t'h'at -> wor'ld'
		3/	cmd_str = ls -la | grep another
			lexed = ls -> -la -> | -> grep -> another
	Then each seperated strings get a token, these token shall be used for parser
3) Parser (Hardest)
	Parser received seperated strings and tokens, then make command table.
	Parser will find if any input string contained command, and option. Then check the grammar of cmd_str, if it's not valid, the parser won't send to execute.
	Here's the command table
		
		cmd -> option 1 -> option 2 -> args
4) Expander (Hard)
	It actually part of Parser, it expaned the string in case some characters are found. Once the expansion finish, it remove quote unless that quote was quoted.
	Here's are the list of expander
	1/ Shell parameter expansion
	2/ Command substitution
	3/ Arithmetic expansion
	4/ Quote removal
5) Executor (Medium)
	One the cmd_str has been parsed and expanded, it is executed. Pipex knowledge is beneficial for this part espescially bonus.

================================= Limitation ===================================

Only one global variable is allowed, I think it should be struct containing the computer's environments as it's required for several main structure.
Furthermore, some command is prohibited which mean auxillary function is required.
